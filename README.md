# Project Description
This project series demonstrates different approaches to state management in React applications by building an interactive counter application. Starting with React‚Äôs built-in useState hook, we progressively implement more sophisticated state management solutions including Context API and Redux. The project showcases how to share state across multiple components and maintain application-wide data consistency.

# Learning Objectives
By completing these projects, you will:

Understand fundamental React state management using useState
Learn to implement global state management with Context API
Master Redux for complex state management scenarios
Compare different state management solutions
Implement state persistence across components
Understand the concept of single source of truth
Learn to structure applications for scalable state management
# Requirements
Technical Requirements
Node.js (v14 or later)
npm or yarn package manager
React (v18 or later)
# TypeScript
Next.js framework
Redux Toolkit (for the Redux implementation)
React-Redux bindings
Development Environment
Code editor (VS Code recommended)
Terminal/command line access
Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, or Edge)
# Best Practices
General React Practices
Component Organization: Keep components small and focused
Type Safety: Utilize TypeScript for type checking
Separation of Concerns: Separate state management from UI components
Immutability: Always treat state as immutable
Single Responsibility: Each component/file should have one primary responsibility
State Management Specific
# Context API:

Create context providers at the appropriate level in the component tree
Use custom hooks for context consumption
Provide proper TypeScript interfaces for context values
# Redux:

Follow Redux Toolkit‚Äôs recommended patterns
Use slices for modular state management
Type your Redux store and actions
Create typed hooks for dispatch and selector usage
# Performance:

Memoize selectors when necessary
Avoid unnecessary re-renders with proper state selection
Consider using Redux middleware for complex side effects

# Expected Outcomes
After completing all versions, you will have: 1. A working counter application with three different state management implementations 2. Understanding of when to use each state management solution 3. Practical experience with modern React state management patterns 4. A foundation for building more complex stateful applications 5. Ability to make informed decisions about state management in your projects

# ‚ö†Ô∏è Note:
While copying and pasting code may seem quick and convenient, it often hinders true understanding. To get the most out of this learning experience, we strongly recommend that you:

Carefully read and understand the instructions for each task.
Type the code yourself to internalize the logic and structure.
Experiment and test your code to see how it works in practice.
Hands-on practice leads to deeper learning and long-term retention. Keep coding!

#### üìù Project Assessment (Hybrid)

Your project will be evaluated primarily through manual reviews. To ensure you receive your full score, please:

‚úÖ Complete your project on time
üìÑ Submit all required files
üîó Generate your review link
üë• Have your peers review your work

An auto-check will also be in place to verify the presence of core files needed for manual review.

# ‚è∞ Important Note
If the deadline passes, you won‚Äôt be able to generate your review link‚Äîso be sure to submit on time!

We‚Äôre here to support your learning journey. Happy coding! ‚ú®
